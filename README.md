    .NET

Function Specification

I was required to implement the following function:

python

def solution(A):

Input

    An array A of N integers.

Output

    Returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

Examples

    Given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
    Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
    Given A = [-1, -3], the function should return 1.

Constraints

    N is an integer within the range [1..100,000].
    Each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].
